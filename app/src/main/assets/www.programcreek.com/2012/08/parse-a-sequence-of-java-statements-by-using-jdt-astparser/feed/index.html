		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes parser.createAST(null); returns an empty Block, but sometimes it works.


In my case I have a java file with about 10 methods, most are private, all are static, one or two accept a parameter.  Three of these methods work every time and the rest always return empty.  The main method is one that has contents in the Block (has a parameter String[] args), another method called fillArray() works and has no parameters and the last working one is called setFilename(String filename).  


The main method is public, setFilename is public, fillArray is private, all are static.  The main method and setFilename have void return type, fillArray returns a boolean...


I have monitored the variables as they get to the createAST(null) statement and the source charArray is populated correctly for each method in the file.


I&#039;m stumped as to what makes these three methods stand out and work as compared to the rest.  The program under test has no warnings or errors according to eclipse and runs as expected both in eclipse and via command line.


Do you know why the other methods may be returning an empty Block?]]></description>
