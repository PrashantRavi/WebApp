		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps but that wasn&#039;t the question Bob. I completely disagree with your conclusion. Too many professional developers forget they are paid to write software, generally for sale, not rewrite the language in their own image. 

This is a derivative of,
1) get it working.
2) get it working correctly.
3) If, and only if, there is a performance problem in that piece of code, optimize the implementation. 

If they wanted to know how to implement a DeQueue that should/would have been the question.

The meta answer I gave was I do not reinvent the language unless I absolutely need to. And that was two years ago....c&#039;mon dude.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm, I know it&#039;s not the point here, but I wouldn&#039;t accept Stack as an answer: it&#039;s synchronised and based on Vector. This may have been the answer way back more than 10 years ago, today a better answer may be: use ArrayDeque or LinkedList instance though the Deque interface, but one should be able to whip one up from scratch on request, because it&#039;s so simple.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you give any example of your statement? How many horrible programmers you know who ended up being in Google, Netflix, etc. - they all take puzzle, algorithms, and such interviews. By now, Google, Facebook, Netflix, LinkedIn, Apple, etc. have the best programmers. Hence they are the best companies. 

For your solution, &quot;I&#039;d develop in a language which supports lists natively&quot; - you take for granted that the language exists, and it can exec a Linked List. Whoa!! Someone intelligent has to create that first, right? for it to exist, for you to then use it!

Referring your comment below, industry leading companies - might not be the companies who create things. For eg., Accenture/ServiceNow, etc. are industry leading companies for the &quot;Service Industry&quot;. How many patents have they filed?

Compare them  to patents filed by Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.

Industry leading companies usually want to &quot;pick up the best reference and implement it&quot; - like you said. But who creates those as references?
Someone should create a masterpiece, to be chosen and used by others. 

Companies like Google, Facebook, etc. &quot;create&quot; things. And that&#039;s why they are fair in taking such interview. 

Experience of XYZ yrs, is an important thing, very important. But &quot;raw intelligence&quot; is also very important. Both go hand in hand. Companies that are shaping the technology around us, want to be sure that they are hiring intelligent people. So that, when some entirely new problem has to be solved (which can&#039;t be solved with previous experience), it can be done.
