I write a project with heavy mathematics involved and GMPY2 excels. 

I have to say I am not familiar with Java.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do not get this article. The lines needed comparison is silly. You can use a library that wraps the low level api in java and come up with a single line functions. So that is irrelevant, only difference I see is python compiler is not smart enough to have multi line code, How does a more primitive become better?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No it won&#039;t. Pyinstaller isnt a compiler, its a packager. If you want compiled speed you can use the cython compiler (Theres a few wrinkles),, Psyco or PyPy for its JIT features.  And finally, and relevant to Jython, Jython can compile out to jvm bytecode ,  and its quite sensible java jvm bytecode too. THEN you can wrap it with PyInstaller.

ctypes in my opinion is the most useful one if you dont need JVM, as you can get in there and start wiring in static types and low cost abstractions of external C libs, which can buy you *very* good performance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A better way of doing this with python is this:

with open(&quot;/home/xiaoran/Desktop/test.txt&quot;) as infile:
.... print infile.read()

And that will close it  automatically when it leaves the block.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure what the point your making is. We know that, and that factors into decisions on what languages to use. If we want something thats type safe , due to mission criticality, we might chose Java. If we want something thats duck typed , to accelerate development we might chose Python. 

Also, for all purposes, Jython and Python are more or less the same, with a different library ecosystem (Jython will work for any library that supports the 2.x line of pythons and doesnt need C extensions , although theres a project in the works to address that last point), though from my experience theres some great Java libraries out there that work just fine with Python, even if they are not so &quot;pythonic&quot; (and to some extent you&#039;ll need to get used to the wind in your hair when it comes to trusting Jythons type introspection).]]></description>
