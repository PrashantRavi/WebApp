		<description><![CDATA[I think you could have chosen another example. This is a really good website, however, you really don&#039;t need such an example to make your point. Maybe the predominantly male software engineers do not find this offensive ( and understandably so). As a woman who is also a software engineer, I find this objectifying women in general(unnecessary, because I understood Decorator just as well without the need to &#039;decorate&#039; a girlfriend). Maybe some men might find my comment unnecessary, but in a field that already has such a low female population, I think we need to stop alienating women by creating such examples (which are not only unrelatable, but also offensive). I would really appreciate you changing this example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. I think they can. If science and art extend girl directly and they compose a girl instance and a call to science [should delegate to the composed girl instance + extra functionality]
To your argument 
For example girl2 might have feature one and feature two, girl 3 has feature 4 and 5. Without decorator pattern, you need to create more subclasses. 

Let&#039;s say there were 100 features, you could still have 100 subclasses. And if you wanted a combination of feature 1, 2,3 then you can still live with the 100 classes(not create any new classes ) . Feature1 can compose feature 2 (as a girl) which can compose feature3(as a girl).

This brings me to ask the question again.
Do we really need the abstract decorator or can we live with implementing the features as subclasses which compose a girl.
In my humble opinion, latter seems to be OK. 
Do you think that we still need the abstract decorator?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Doing so can result in class explosion. What if the girl has 8 other features,and this 8 other features is needed on other area, and must have certain combinations. For example girl2 might have feature one and feature two, girl 3 has feature 4 and 5. Without decorator pattern, you need to create more subclasses. What if you have 100 features that has various combinations. Then you will need to create more subclassess. This will be a nightmare.]]></description>
