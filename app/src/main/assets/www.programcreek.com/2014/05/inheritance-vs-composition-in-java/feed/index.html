		<description><![CDATA[While I agree with your conclusions, I think the &#039;is-a&#039; vs &#039;has-a&#039; relationship isn&#039;t really so clear-cut. For example, if you have a few insects defined that are implement Attack, you might have a collection of them, which might be something like:


Collection attackers = ...


In this case, the Attack interface seems to be named incorrectly - we don&#039;t have a collection of attacks. We have a collection of attackers. So, we could refactor the Attack interface to be Attacker.


Collection attackers = ...


Now, a bee IS AN insect, but a bee also IS AN attacker, it doesn&#039;t HAVE-A attacker. So just by renaming the interface to an arguably more correct name, the waters are muddied completely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[that should invoke the move() method of insect class?????
The answer to your question is the syntax to call method(Instance method) is obj.method() and the obj here refers to Bee Object.  for calling methods specifically to Parent Class we use super keyword.
You can also write a small code and test it your self.]]></description>
