		<description><![CDATA[here foo and bar are pointing to the same memory location contains value &quot;foo&quot; when bar is initialised as &quot;bar&quot; separate memory is located to hold value &quot;bar&quot; . so now bar variable points to the new object contains &quot;bar&quot; value. next print statement foo prints &quot;foo&quot; because foo var points to &quot;foo&quot; object. bar prints &quot;bar&quot; since it points to the bar object. If assuming string is immutable than foo will print &quot;bar&quot; not &quot;foo&quot; because bar and foo variable points to same object hence by using bar variable you changed object value. i hope this helps]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In your example, &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; are the immutable string objects, whereas foo and bar are the references to these string object.
Fortunately, we can swap a value with another one, for a given reference ! That is the reason why bar variable has been assigned the &quot;bar&quot; value after having been assigned the &quot;foo&quot; value first.

Eventually, immutable means that you are not able to change &quot;bar&quot; value (for example, if you want to add a letter to &quot;bar&quot;, you have no other choice than creating a new instance of a string : you can t reuse the &quot;bar&quot; instance. It causes a more important memory print, but in thé other hand you benefit from the advantages written here (i do not totally agree with security remarks, though).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please tell me why does this happen and why is it allowed if String is immutable.
http://ideone.com/6Na6Dq 
&lt;code&gt;
String foo = &quot;foo&quot;;
String bar = &quot;foo&quot;;
bar = &quot;bar&quot;;
System.out.println(foo); //prints foo
System.out.println(bar); // prints bar

&lt;/code&gt;]]></description>
