		<description><![CDATA[Yes, it&#039;s good to understand that Java arrays are different from other collections, and from strings.  But no need to act like that&#039;s A Good Thing just because Java does it that way.  The fact that we can&#039;t get to the class for arrays is annoying in many ways.  More recent (and, older) languages have included arrays that meet a Collections interface with `get`, `set`, and `size` methods, rather than inventing a type with its own syntax for get &#038; set.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in my second year in comp. sci. and personally I hate Eclipse and autocompletion. (Espeically when those prints automatically turn into println&#039;s).
