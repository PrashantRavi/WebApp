		<description><![CDATA[If you find this article helpful - think! What this articles does benchmark is adding values to various sets. 
The much more important question is: What are you doing with the set once the values are added?
Of course a TreeSet is slow when adding values because all new values are sorted. That&#039;s why you would normally avoid filling a TreeSet like that all together (You&#039;d fill an array/LinkedHashSet and initialize your TreeSet with that array).
BUT: A TreeSet is very fast if you want to randomly access values in your Set because it has been sorted and there is no need to walk through the Array or LinkedList that backs the other lists.
All LinkedStuff is slow when randomly accessing values but they are very fast when moving or replacing objects.
Lastly: A HashSet is the most memory demanding of them all. If you have lots of RAM and you want resonable performance for read and writes to your set, this is the one to use.
Summary: Which Set is the fastest cannot simply be benchmarked by adding values to different types of sets. The right set for your use case may be dependent on more than just the performance during set initialization.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Friends,, this is a nice code, works 100% perfect.
do not worry about the results. it depends upon the System you are using. and also the Processor business. Every time you run this code, it will give different results


Thanks :)]]></description>
