		<description><![CDATA[I would say &quot;different&quot; not &quot;improved&quot;.  If you are plucking many small substrings from a big string that say represents file contents (my most common case) you will use more RAM with the JDK 7 method than with the JDK 6.  If you need to keep the big string around JDK 6 is better. If you want to avoid pinning big string in RAM the JDK 7 method is better. I gather it would not have been practical to make it a compile time option since this decision is so pervasive.]]></description>

Found another nice article that explains the memory leak possibility well in Java 6
