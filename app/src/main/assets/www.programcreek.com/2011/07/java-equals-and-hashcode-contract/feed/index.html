		<description><![CDATA[I think it would be helpfull to add that if you use same object reference as it was stored in map i.e. System.out.println(m.get(a1)); you will see the correct result. This explains that if hashCode is not overridden, a default implementation will be used which is always identical for same object. Having sailed that, you should always override hashCode method if object is going to be used in hash based collection]]></description>

Excuse me ,I am of a question , but I don&#039;t know what is it it&#039;s subject to ask..

		<description><![CDATA[I find it tedious to implement equals() and hashCode() by hand. I also see too many mistakes in code in this area. Better to automate this, so I have just released a free open source tool VALJOGen (valjogen.41concepts.com) which can generate your value classes with setters/getters (*), Object.hashCode, Object.equals, Object.toString, Comparable.compareTo and more from plain java interfaces. The generated output can be automatically updated when you change your interfaces - no need to maintain the generated code. Let me know what you think?]]></description>
