		<description><![CDATA[If you can present more details on how lucene index works, that would be great.  Personally I&#039;m comfortable with my understanding of b*tree in terms of things like:  adding an entry, deleting an entry, splitting a block, scanning, range scan and all that stuff.  And more stuff, reading an index block, the kinds of searchs that are helped by b*tree, and *not* helped by b*tree.  I would love to get to a similar place with lucene indexing.]]></description>
