		<description><![CDATA[To summarize it we can say that whenever we use static modifier for anything - then it is not related to any object.

If a method is made static, it can be called without the object.
A static block is executed at first, even before creation of any class object. Static blocks are usually used to perform initialization activities.
If a variable is static, it is not associated with any class and only one copy of the variable is maintained throughout the execution.]]></description>
