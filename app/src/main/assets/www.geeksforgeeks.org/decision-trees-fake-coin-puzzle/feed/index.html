		<description><![CDATA[A=1. Weigh using a mass spectrometer. 
B=0. Weight already established. Call Stevie Wonder to check for irregularities, failing that put it through a parking meter; those things are notoriously sensitive! 

Binary mate ;)

		<description><![CDATA[for problem 2:
lets say we have 4 coins A, B,C, D.
we weigh A, B.
if(A&#060;B)  or if(A&#062;B) so, either A or B is defective so we choose either A or B.
(say A) and compare with C or D(say C).
if(A==C) B is defective else A is defective, so the total comparison is 2.

take other case when. 
(A=b)

if(A==B)
we compare either A or B (say A) with either C or D(say C).
if(A==C) D is defective.
else if(A!=C) so C is defective.
so the total comparison is 2.

so you see, the minimum comparison even in worst case is 2.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As skt mentioned,k&#062;=log3(2N+1) is right soluton because ,if N=4 , ( N+1(genuine))k comes out as 2 which is right answer....basically my point is just applying equal to in answer of 2nd problem with lesser integer is sufficient to solve problem 3.....let me know if i am wrong.

For N=12 , problem 2 and problem 3 generate same answer 3 if we go according venki..while for N=12 , in problem 3 answer should be 2...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there is a simple &#038; obvious way to solve &quot;Problem 2&quot;.

Out of 4 coin (named as A B C D), Select any one Coin &#038; weight with remaining 3 coins. Suppose I take coin A. A may be genuine or counterfeit.

If A is counterfeit then all the remaining coin will be either lighter or heavier or equal during weighting. If all the coins are lighter, means A is heavier. All the coins are heavier, means A is lighter, else no Counterfeit coin exist.

If A is genuine, means counterfeit coin may or may not be in B,C,D. So weight B,C,D with A. If all the weighting are same no counterfeit. If counterfeit exists then for sure 2 out of 3 weighting will be equal. So based on 1 different weighting, we can judge that coin(opposite of A) is lighter or heavier. 


Plse tell me... someone.. if any mistake is there...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want to say is that pair coins as (1,2) (3,4) (5,6) etc... and weigh them against each other. If the weights are equal for every pair, leave that pair. The anomaly occurs with only one pair. Weigh each coin of this(anomaly) pair with G. 

Thank you]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In problem 3, is there a need for building a tree? 
Please correct me if i am wrong.

Group whole coins as groups of 2. There will be one pair, which we have an anamoly whether one coin is greater or not. Cheking those two coins with genuine would give us whether the defective is heavy or not]]></description>
