		<description><![CDATA[Hi! Actually , my doubt was in a different context. Recursive functions , and function calls like your example will always need stack frames to store variables in between calls. But if one reads the line: 


&quot;&lt;b&gt;When a new block scope is opened, a symbol table is pushed onto a stack. When the closing curly brace is encountered, the scope is closed and the symbol table is popped.&quot; &lt;/b&gt; 


It seems that symbol tables are being preserved or remembered in between iterative calls, or between loops (considering the reference to curly brace}, when there is apparently no need. This is what I didn&#039;t quite get!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice question. To understand this take an example, Consider a function calling another function and returning. Before calling another function, the current data (symbol table ) must be saved for future use( after returning ).


ex: 


fun1()
{
int a=5;
fun2();// symbol table is pushed
//symbol table is popped
a=a+1; //here we need the value of a 
} 
fun2()
{
int a=10;
}


I think now u understood the purpose of remembering,instead of destroying .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@geeksforgeeks:disqus : The line : &quot;But that symbol table is remembered, rather than destroyed&quot; is not clear. Why does the compiler remember the variables declared locally? Isnt the scope of local variables limited to the block in which they are declared. What is the need of sphagetti stack?]]></description>
