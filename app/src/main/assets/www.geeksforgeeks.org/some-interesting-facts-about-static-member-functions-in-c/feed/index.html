		<description><![CDATA[1. Members of Structure are by default Public in nature whereas in class they are private.
2. When deriving a Struct  from some base class/structure, the  default access specifier for a base class/structure is public.
While deriving a class, the access specifier is private.
3. Also, Classes can have explicitly parameterless constructors whereas structures can’t.
4. Member variable initialization is possible in class whereas in Structures, it is not.
5. It is not possible to declare destructor in structure but in class it is possible.
6. The “this” keyword gives different meaning in structure and class. How?
In class, “this” keyword is classified as value type of class type within which it is used like inside instance constructor or instance method.
In structure, “this” keyword is classified as variable type of structure type within which it is used.
7.One more main difference is that the structures are value types and the classes are reference types.So object of structure store in stack exactly like any other value type like an Integer, a double
 but object of class store in heap.You can assigned null to class variable but you can&#039;t assigned null value to structure variable]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is the difference between class and structure?

structure also have inheritance,object overloading,overriding,access specifiers,scope resolution operator...etc.
The things that doesn&#039;t work with structure is only abstract and virtual.
But I don&#039;t think so,,,for that only they&#039;ve invented class.

Thanking you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If Static member functions are declared const, then it means that our intention is like: we have access to a particular object and we are not allowed to modify the contents of that object. So, since we dont have access to a particular object in a static member function, we cannot declare it const.

If static member functions are declared volatile, 
we have access to a volatile( or non-volatile ) object and the compiler is not allowed to optimize code in this function which shall affect the state of that object because of its volatility. But, since static member functions do not have access to a particular instance of a class, then this situation need not arise. So, static member functions can&#039;t be declared volatile. 
So, on a side-note, non-static member functions can be declared const volatile.]]></description>
