		<description><![CDATA[Hello Venky,

First of all, I liked the way you explained the concept. But I am not convinced with a Create function with in Base class. The reason is the implementation of Create function. If you look at the implementation of a function, it says that the base class is aware of a derived class which does not make sense in terms of OOPS. 

Further to this, if a client of this library wants to write a class derived from a base class, then the object of this class cannot be created with Base::Create().

		<description><![CDATA[@Anand,

1. Virtual constructor &#039;decouples&#039; tight binding between class type associated with object construction.

&lt;em&gt;Decoupling is one of fundamental object oriented principle.&lt;/em&gt;

When there is new class addition (extension), the user needs to be aware of that class. Otherwise how can he make use the functionality of new class? But however, he need not to compile his code due to extension of library. He can get new functionality of existing code just by providing new input, and using new library code provided by vendor.

Perhaps one can add one more level of abstraction to the User class. Instead of simple integer as input you can pass a polymorphic object, based on which required object will be created. Again what polymorphic object to be passed is application specific, like reading a configuration file or some input from an external source.

&lt;em&gt;The core intention is to decouple tight binding between object creation and class type.&lt;/em&gt; Agreed, there is some memory leak, we can handle easily. Just delete previous object prior to creating new object. As said, the intention is not to clutter the code with so many defensive techniques.

2. The word virtual constructor is conceptual. Need not be associated with usual C++ naming nomenclature. Pattern world calls it as &quot;Factory Method or Creator Method&quot;.

Being static type, C++ won&#039;t allow virtual constructors. There are languages that directly supports virtual constructors. When language has limitations to provide greater decoupling, programmer emulates required behaviour via some predetermined solutions (patterns).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Venky,

Nice aticle.

1. as you want the user class to be free of real type, you can update the constructor of User class to take any from console and send it to base::create and check for a nullptr to see if you got an object, or else every time a new class is added, you will have to update the console messages in c&#039;tor of User. A very trivial one, but just thought to mention, as you are very clear in your concept, but your reader may not be.

2. do you think, you can use the word constructor for create function, when it is not actually ceating the object itself.

Thanks
Anand S]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@levis, there are many good books on patterns in C++/Java/C#/Objective C/Python/Ruby/... When language can&#039;t provide an inbuilt solution to recurring problem in design, programmer emulate that using patterns.

For Virtual Constructor idiom, you can refer More Effective C++ by Mayers and Modern C++ Design by Andrei. There might be even better books, I would prefer these two.

Note that it is more important to learn design principles than directly reading patterns. Read OOP principles first.]]></description>
