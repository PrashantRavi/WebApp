		<description><![CDATA[I agree with perica, I fixed this problem by doing different actions depending on the triplet being collinear, clockwise or counterclockwise.

whenever you find a triplet that is collinear you want to pop the middle element but keep the first and the last in the triplet.

(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2) is encountered. Pop (1, 1) and let the two topmost be (0, 0), (2, 2) instead.

I am not sure if the compare function sorts on angle and then prioritize the furthest or the closest, my sorting function sorts on angle and then picks the closest to the pivot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this code has one mistake. If the first three points in sorted array that are put on stack are collinear, then the output will contain all three points, and it should contain just the first and the third. Also when you have 4 or more collinear points at the beginning it will produce a run-time error]]></description>
