		<description><![CDATA[An access for a memory location in a different page does not necessarily mean flushing cache always(i guess). Once the first miss for static variable happens then it is fetched and automatically it is cached. But the newly fetched cache line might be replaced again depending upon the memory access pattern and cache line replacement strategy.

		<description><![CDATA[By the same logic if you ever have a multidimensional array for example arr[i][j] and you have a choice of setting i=10 &#038; j=100 or i=100 and j=10 you would choose the earlier as the loop to iterate through it would be more efficient in the loop above. Just thought that was something worth mentioning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The solution is evaluated based on mathematics. If we apply the concepts of locality of reference, the performace evaluation will be different. Consider we are accessing a static variable inside the body of inner loop. Think of it as huge buffer containing an image data.

There are two types of locality of reference, temporal and spacial. Since the loop code is condensed, it will have good space and temporal locality. However, there will be penality every time when the static variable is accessed, since it could be sotred in data section (most probably different page).

Friends, comments please. I just gave thought.]]></description>
