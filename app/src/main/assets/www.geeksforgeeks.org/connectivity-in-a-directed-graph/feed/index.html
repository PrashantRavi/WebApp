		<description><![CDATA[another type of connectivity is singly connected
for directed graph -is singly connected if for each pair of vertex u,v there is at most one simple path from u to v ....so either there is no path exist bw u and v or only 1 
STEPS FOR DETERMINING SINGLY CONNECTIVITY
-&#062;run dfs from vertex i
-&#062;classify tree,forward,and cross edges in that dfs
-&#062;eneque the vertex in a queue
while queue is not empty
v=q.del()
find all the ancestors of the verices including itself
if there exist a forward edge or cross edge on any one of its ancestor then there is more than 1  path....return false
if not eneque all its child 
repeat the process while queue is not empty
-&#062;do it for all d vertices]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[METHOD 1-do dfs in grpah chosing any vertex if it covers all vertex then all vertices are reachable from dat vertex
now run dfs on the reversed graph with dat vertex and if it again covers all vertex then graph is strongly connected


METHOD 2-form path matrix either by warshal algorithm or powers of adjacnnt matrix if all the entries are 1 then it is strongly connected

METHOD 3-run dfs from each vertex and check ...(dont use it)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Exactly what I was looking for.  Many thanks for posting.  I find your implementation of a graph structure more accessible than Sedgewick&#039;s.

For the purpose of what I wanted, which was a simple yes/no test to say whether the network is connected or not (doesn&#039;t matter how strongly) I guess I just need to make use of isSC() up to and including step 2 and not bother with steps 3 + onward.

		<description><![CDATA[yes...
consider the above case..there is a directed path (arc) from 0 to every vertex and also there is path from every other vertex to 0. Now consider any 2 random vertices V1 and V2. Then obviously there is a path from V1 to V2 via 0 as we know V1 is connected to 0 (every vertex is connected to 0) and 0 is connected to V2 (0 is connected to every vertex)

Hope this helps..! : )]]></description>
