		<description><![CDATA[It is very simple if we look at how the arrays are accessed

array[i] is evaluated as *(array + i)

where &quot;array&quot; will represent the base address and i the offset. So if &quot;array&quot; is a pointer variable, then base address will the address contained in the variable and if &quot;array&quot; is a single dimensional array, then it will represent the base address of the array. So the evaluation results will be the same..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have seen  lot of people confuse arrays with pointers. It is true that arrays decays into pointers while it is passed into
a function as a parameter, but its kind of bad practice to
use arrays and pointers interchangably to refer to one another

For example
&lt;pre&gt; &lt;code language=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
//declaration
extern char *ptr;
//definition
char ptr[10]; 
&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;

so access of p[i] using extern will produce a character(garabage), but program treat it as pointers, if you dereference this garbage, you might get what you
want but it will fail mysteriously at some later point in the program(if you have big program) then debugging takes years to figure out which variables is stepping on each other.



Pointers Holds the address of data. Array On the hand holds the data itself

In Pointers Data is access indirectly, i.e two instructions

example
&lt;pre&gt; &lt;code language=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
char *s = &#034;Hello&#034;;
c = s[i]
&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;

a.compiler symbol table lookup for s  is done
b. get the contents of s
c. now get the value of i and addit to s [s + i]

In arrays data is accessed directly


pointers typically points to annonymous data.

usually pointer arithmetic for array operation
uses subscript for example 
s[i]   get value of &quot;i&quot; past &quot;s&quot;

Array On the hand holds the data itself
data is accessed directly 

pointers need malloc(), free, otherwise it will fail
Arrays don&#039;t need any such thing, as it is automatically 
allocated and deallocated.]]></description>
