		<description><![CDATA[As per this we must have 3 keys for each node,instead of this some node are having t-1 keys,like in 3a when a node gets a key from above to form t-1 keys constraint and we move its subling&#039;s key to root and if subling has only 3 children then it will now have 2 children....so it will have t-1 keys..dont we required  t min keys here also?]]></description>

@ Balasubramanian.N

Please explain this with example

You should interpret the following specification for deletion from a B-tree with the understanding that if the root node x ever becomes an internal node having no keys (this situation can occur in cases 2c and 3b then we delete x, and x’s only child x.c1 becomes the new root of the tree, decreasing the height of the tree by one and preserving the property that the root of the tree contains at least one key (unless the tree is empty).

Do we need to maintain (t-1)+1 as minimum keys for each node instead of (t-1)

Please let me know if m missing anything,

Thanks in advance]]></description>
