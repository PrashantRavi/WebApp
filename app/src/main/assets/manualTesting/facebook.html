<p>In this post we will present some test scenarios of Facebook. Although there would be thousands of test cases for facebook but we are limiting the tests to common features like - profile setting, comments and post in timeline etc. We will leave features like creating signup, login, page creation, groups creation, events etc. Please note that the below mentioned scenarios are for reference only to teach the concept of test scenario writing, the tests are nowhere related to actual Facebook's testing.<br>For login and registration functionality check <a href="login.html">Test Scenarios for Login</a> and <a href="registration.html">Test Scenarios for Registration</a>.</p>
